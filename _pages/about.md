Hi, I'm just an idiot person who wants to be the artist. :metal:! Since there are lots of interesting things around the world, I want to capture those things and note those into my space.

I'm going to post my blog mostly in Korean. But if there's more time to post, I'm planning to switch the it into english, or sometimes the language I'm interested in.

Let's cherish every moment! :v:
매순간을 소중하게! :v:
