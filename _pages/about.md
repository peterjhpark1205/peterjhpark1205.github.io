Hi, I'm just an idiot who wants to be the artist. :metal: <br>
This blog is my personal learning space. <br>

My post will mostly be in Korean.<br>
But when there's time some posts may be written in English or some other language.<br>

I hope I can steadily post on this blog,<br>
so that more people including me can enjoy the world better.<br>

Let's cherish every moment! :v: <br>
매순간을 소중하게! :v:
