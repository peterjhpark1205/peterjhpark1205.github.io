Hi, I'm just an idiot who wants to be the artist. :metal: <br>
There are many kinds of artist. I just want to be the artist who can appreciate things around the world.<br>
Maybe I can't be the artist, but I want to capture the precious moments around me.<br>

This blog is my personal learning space. <br>
My posts will mostly be in Korean.<br>
But when there's time some posts may be written in English or some other language.<br>

I hope I can steadily post on this blog,<br>
so that more people including me can enjoy the world better.<br>

Enjoy! :woman_dancing::man_dancing: <br>
