Hi, I'm just an idiot who wants to be the artist. :metal: <br>
There are many ways to define the artist, but I just want to be the artist who can appreciate things around the world.<br>
I want to capture the precious things and write those down on my blog.<br>

My posts will mostly be in Korean.<br>
But when there's time, some posts may be written in English or some other language.<br>

I hope I can steadily post on this blog, so that I can appreciate the world better.<br>

If some happens to watch my blog, I hope you to enjoy.<br>

Let's enjoy the moments! :tada: <br>
